1) Clean the data or add functionality for more types of searches; for example, all states are abbreviated and lowercase: a dictionary with the state/state abbreviation pairs could allow for users to search the entire state name. 

2) Further cleaning of data for consistent styling. For example, some durations are listed as "1 minute" while others are listed as "1 min".
